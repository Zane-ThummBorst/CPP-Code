In our tests we can see that time improved does not scale linearly with the number of threads dedicated to the program.
This is most apparent when we compare the improvements from 1 to 2 threads and from 3 to 4 threads. The gains from 1 to 2
are quite high with an improvement of around 2 seconds. wher from 3 to 4 we gain around .1 seconds.It would seem that yes it does continue
to improve, but with diminishing returns the more threads with an increase in threads dedicated.
